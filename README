## apt-transport-s3
Connect servers to your S3 hosted apt repository using Boto 3.

## Requirements
### Additional package dependencies 
1. python-configobj (installed by default in Debian)
2. boto3

## Configuration

Communication with S3 is via Boto3 and authentication is provided via profiles. A setup guide, including AWS regional settings
can be found <a href="http://boto3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide/configuration.html">here</a>

A profile name should then be passed to /etc/apt/s3auth.conf

Example of s3auth.conf file:
```
profile = yourProfileName
```

## Usage
The bucket repo should be specified using an s3:// prefix, for example:

`deb s3://aptbucketname/repo/ trusty main contrib non-free`

Note: The S3 region should be determined within `~/.aws/config` and therefore a FQDN is not required within the apt source.
